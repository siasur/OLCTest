# OLCTest * Perlin-like Noise Visualization

This is my take on a visualizer for Perlin-like Noise. It is inspired by the "manual" walktrough in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-0UaeJBumA) video by javidx9.  
It uses the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine),

Internally it uses 512 points for the in and output. The user can manually change each 8th input, to modify the result.

## Keys:
Numpad 5 -> Generate new random input  
Numpad + -> Increase octaves  
Numpad - -> Decrease octaves
